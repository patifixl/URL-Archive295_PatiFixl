          People have always been collecting items and creating extensive and
          beautiful collections over their life time, whether to decorate a
          space, make household tasks easier, improve their work life, etc. In
          the digital context people also collect - the items of their
          collections often are links. With it’s vast storage capacity, the
          digital realm offers increased potential of what it means to
          preserve.<br /><br />

          URL Archive 295 is inspired by Tom Grote’s *Eindhovenseweg 56* sheds
          light on a collection that is rich in personal but also neutral
          values. Borrowing from the space of a Study (*Father’s Study*) it aims
          to serve the author and the user of the website as a source of
          inspiration, as a space to get unstuck in and revisit the steps that
          guided the design process. The archive with its categorised, filtered
          content is meant to act as a tool to facilitate design practice.

              without documents, constantly at risk of deportation. Ravic,
              resigned to a loveless life, unexpectedly finds romance in the

            <p>
              From one of our most powerful writers, a work of stunning
              frankness about losing a daughter. Richly textured with bits of
              her own childhood and married life with her husband, John Gregory
              Dunne, and daughter, Quintana Roo, this book by Joan Didion
              examines her thoughts, fears, and doubts regarding having
              children, illness, and growing old. Blue Nights—the long, light
              evening hours that signal the summer solstice, “the opposite of
              the dying of the brightness, but also its warning”—like The Year
              of Magical Thinking before it, is an iconic book of incisive and
              electric honesty, haunting and profoundly moving.

              the act, he descends into a maelstrom of confusion, paranoia, and

              The subject of the titular trial is the undefined guilt of Joseph
              K., a bank clerk and the protagonist of the novel. As a result of
              the trial, the protagonist is sentenced to death. The trial itself
              is absurd in nature. The accused doesn't know what he's being
              accused of and has no means of defense. The title of the novel
              refers to the individual situation of the protagonist, and carries
              a metaphorical dimension - the life of every person is such a
              process.

              Through dozens of murky photographs and sometimes morbidly
              forthright observations, Sanne Peper details her search for the
              traces of Southern Gothic iconography in the Deep South of the
              United States. In literature, the Southern Gothic style is one
              that employs the use of macabre, ironic events to examine the
              values of the American South, exploring social issues and
              revealing its cultural character. Impenetrable swamps, decaying
              automobiles, trees draped in Spanish moss, ghost towns, shacks in
              the forest, moonshine, and colourful characters all make their
              appearance in Pepers first-hand cross-section of this
              unforgettable landscape. With a short story by Jim White.

              each night to comfort him. Unbeknownst to her, he adjusts it
              himself to spare her grief. This act of love leaves a lasting
              impact on the narrator, who acquires the vest as a symbol of their
              deep love after their passing.

              Genre: Tragedy
            </p>

            <p>
              When Randle Patrick McMurphy (Jack Nicholson) gets transferred for
              evaluation from a prison farm to a mental institution, he assumes
              it will be a less restrictive environment. But the martinet Nurse
              Ratched (Louise Fletcher) runs the psychiatric ward with an iron
              fist, keeping her patients cowed through abuse, medication and
              sessions of electroconvulsive therapy. The battle of wills between
              the rebellious McMurphy and the inflexible Ratched soon affects
              all the ward's patients.

              A collection of short texts that vary in terms of atmosphere,
              themes, and even genre weight. What unites them, however, is the
              author's unique perspective on reality and the accompanying sense
              of bizarreness that readers experience during the reading.

            <p>
              A philosophical novel by Czech author Milan Kundera, first
              published in 1984. It is set in Prague during the 1968 Warsaw Pact
              invasion of Czechoslovakia. Originally written in French and later
              translated into English, it was hailed for its originality and
              depth by Elizabeth Hardwick. The novel explores a complex love
              story and the impact of communist ideology. Thanks to its literary
              craftsmanship, it has become a significant work in existentialism
              and received the Los Angeles Times Book Prize in 1984.

            <p>
              A Botanical Symbol for a National Myth considers symbols as a
              means of grounding abstract concepts, thereby producing ways of
              seeing and acting in the world. The project explores how, through
              this process, nature has become reduced to a set of images
              portraying a narrative of pure and unspoiled land, facilitating
              its commodification.

              The stories we tell are based on our memories and the objects
              around us. Documenting is a form of preservation and what is
              preserved tells a history. These are the traces of an existence.
              It tells both the personal life of a family and a bigger story. An
              ode to the life of his parents and his youth, but also an
              archaeological narrative of a recent history. A voyage of
              discovery between dream and reality, in which the observer will
              recognise himself and where their own memories and lost objects
              are given a new life.

            <p>
              OASE Journal was founded in 1981 as a student-run publication in
              the Netherlands “addressing issues in architecture from a
              perspective closely related to education and research.” Over
              nearly four decades the periodical has deeply explored various and
              specific aspects of architectural practice maintaining the
              “self-reflective, self-educating, and self-empowering” spirit it
              began with. In 1990 (Issue 28), the design of the journal was
              taken over by Karel Martens, entering OASE into a deep and studied
              legacy of Dutch graphic design. Issues of OASE (especially the
              covers) have become a sort of “greatest hits” in Martens’s body of
              work, a showcase of typography, color, materiality, and layout—all
              done on a tight budget. What is perhaps most fascinating is the
              way Martens has evolved his relationship with OASE to coincide
              with his own practice. OASE has been an outlet for Martens’s
              personal work, a project for his students at the Werkplaats
              Typografie, and a vehicle for collaboration with his daughter,
              Aagje, and a new generation of designers. The 100th issue of OASE
              is dedicated to Martens’s work on the journal and provides a
              tremendous amount of insight from the editors, former students,
              and Martens himself.

              Ornithology shows photo series of birds in their many forms of
              appearance, categorised in a semi-scientific manner. To seduce the
              reader and to create a unique style for each chapter, Jeremy
              Jansen carefully selected different layouts and types of paper.
              The balance between multifaceted and simplicity is characterised
              in this book. Not immediately visible for all readers, is that the
              photographs in Ornithology have been laid out in a grid. Thanks to
              the uncompromising approach a managed diversity has occurred in
              the overall design.

              Proposes how maps and mapping can be seen and used as tools for
              action, to tie networks, to create political pressure or to create
              visibility for marginalized groups. Maps are thus instruments to
              criticize, educate, show spatial subjectivities and support
              self-reflection.

              "Light travels easily through the internal pages of ‘WHEN I AM NOT
              THERE’. The book is printed on paper with high ‘show-through’—the
              visibility of printing on one side of a sheet of paper on the
              other side. The stock, notable for its uniquely low opacity, is
              designed by book designer Irma Boom. It has the rustle of tissue
              paper wrapping a recent purchase and the fine, lightweight handle
              of a bible paper. The book’s designers Stuart Geddes and Žiga
              Testen sourced the gossamer paper stock for its capacity to create
              unexpected moments between pages, inviting light through its
              fibres and layering the images and text of the book, blending them
              together, confusing its topography. The lightness of the pages is
              a metaphor for the books’ subject: the fugitivity and ephemerality
              of a contemporary dance practice. The book anthologizes the work
              of dancer and choreographer Shelley Lasica and arrives in
              Melbourne in August, just in time, to close its coinciding
              performance-exhibition at MUMA. As a counterpart to the
              performance-exhibition, the book reflectively documents Lasica’s
              career and work, and can also be understood as archival."

              Since 2013, Het Nieuwe Instituut has been researching
              architecture, design, and digital culture, internationally and in
              the Netherlands. In 2019, they focused on addressing burn-out and
              exhaustion in society, exploring new approaches through
              decolonial, post-Anthropocenic, and queering perspectives. They
              seek to reshape existing structures to promote more equitable and
              inclusive ecologies, emphasizing care as a distributed agency
              among humans and non-humans. The initiative aims to foster
              innovative thinking and actions that support multi-species
              cohabitation through design, architecture, and digital culture.

            <p>
              Therapy animals are used to treat various conditions like
              depression, anxiety, PTSD, loneliness, and autism. They offer
              comfort and companionship. While research supports their
              effectiveness, it's essential to acknowledge that like human
              professionals, therapy animals can also experience caregiving
              burnout.

              There's plenty of literature on animal rescue and veterinary care,

          <div class="tresc">
            <p>
              In a frenetic world obsessed with deliverables and results, Jenny
              Odell makes the case for How to Do Nothing: Resisting the
              Attention Economy, arguing not for passivity, wilful ignorance or
              sloth, but rather for the potential we create by refusing
              productivity and redirecting our attention to active modes of
              listening and contemplation. By shining a critical light on the
              ways in which our identities have become entangled with our
              occupations and advocating modes of reclaiming the power of our
              own curiosity, this book will be ideal for all those who feel
              off-kilter in the attention-seeking economy.

              This book explores how society embraced the 'labour of love' myth,
              where some work is seen as passion-driven rather than for pay. It
              looks at the experiences of different workers and exposes how
              we've been deceived into a new work tyranny.

              Objects of Common Interest presents furniture made from liquified
              iridescent resin at the POIKILOS show during Milan Design Week
              2023. They pour resin into molds, and after hardening, incorporate
              natural materials like iron, marble, or wood. This allows the
              furniture to be transformed back into liquid form and reshaped
              while preserving their unique characteristics.

            <p>
              Studio Groovido researched the evolution of ‘UV Mapping’ or the
              process of projecting a 2D picture on the pixel unit of a 3D
              digital model. They followed the history of the process from Retro
              and Arcade RPG games to Voxel Art and Minecraft, even snaking
              through the recent Sandbox Metaverse, and observed the aesthetic
              of pixels. They were enamored by them and looked into the visuals
              of bricks too along the way.

              Exploring the porosity of mediums and narratives by creating
              images employing a scale of techniques, including drawings,
              sculptures and objects. The duo parasites the formats distorting
              the established production flows to develop its own language at
              the intersections of art and design. Endless forms of conversation
              and experimentation are at the core of the work. Everything is an
              image.
